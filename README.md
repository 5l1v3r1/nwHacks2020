Gestures are powerful and easy! We decided to try utilizing the power of our gestures to control essential oil diffusers! Different gestures are captured and used for releasing different essential oils.

Using the raspberry pi 4 and ultrasonic distance sensors, the raspberry pi tracks our motion and triggers the essential oil diffuser to turn on (ultrasonic transducer), releasing the scent you want into the air!
